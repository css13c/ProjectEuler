# Project Euler Solutions

Solutions to [Project Euler problems](https://projecteuler.net). Mainly written with Elixir,
but also written in Python. (Will expand this list as I use more languages). Each language will
have it's own folder.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `elixir_solutions` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:elixir_solutions, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/elixir_solutions](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir_solutions).
