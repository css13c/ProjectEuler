  Solution for Project Euler problem 21:
  > Let d(**n**) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of **n**
  > (numbers less than **n** which divide evenly into **n**).  
  > If d(**a**) = **b** and d(**b**) = **a**, where **a â‰  b**, then
  > **a** and **b** are an amicable pair and each of **a** and **b** are called amicable numbers.
  >
  > For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110;
  > therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
  >
  > Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
